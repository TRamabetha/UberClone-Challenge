# UberClone-Challenge

This is the source code for an uber app clone with location services and requesting capabilities. 
All api have been removed from the google database so to get the app working you are advised to 
create a firebase account and add the app to the account enabling authentication and real time 
database services and also to create a google api and pasting it in the UberClone-Challenge\app\
src\debug\res\values\google_maps_api.xml directory.
